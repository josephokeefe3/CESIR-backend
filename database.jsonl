This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the IPP from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality. Based preliminary studies, the substation\nregulators should be set to \u2018co-generation\u2019 mode if it is a Siemen MJXL or MJ4A control. If it is an older\nM-2001C Beckwith control, it should be upgraded to an M-2001D unit and the \u2018DG\u2019 or \u2018auto\ndetermination\u2019 mode set. These include:\na.

Transmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at\nthis location on the transmission system.\n4. If the IPP cannot comply with the voltage regulation threshold criteria, install new line regulators on the\nutility-side of the PCC location. The new line circuit regulators shall be equipped with reverse power\nflow & co-generation functionality (Beckwith M2001-D).\n5. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary metered service at the PCC.\n** Recloser settings will be determined by Corporate Protection & Control**\n6. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n7. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n8. The existing transmission circuit relaying requires no modifications to accommodate the proposed\ninstallation.\n9. The substation LTC on 42017T3 must be set in DG/Cogen/Auto-Determination mode to in order to be\nable to handle reverse power and co-generation functionality. For analysis purposes as part of this\nreport, it is assumed that the LTC will be set to a 123.0V forward and reverse hold voltage, 3.0V\nbandwidth, no R & X compensation settings, and a time delay of 30.0 seconds.\n10.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of voltage\non any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the generator\ninterconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not applicable\nfor switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of the\nmeter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must be\neither already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality. These include:\nControl is REQUIRED for the Source Regulation:\na. Circuit 5301466 Source Line Regulator at SUB\n8.

Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained as\neffectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be\nrequired to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore,\nverification by the utility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in\norder to energize the generation site.\n13. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Protective Device Coordination\nDue to the amount of generation backfeed, the reclosers at locations (L-398 P-9) must be set\ndirectionally.\n14.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s\nfeasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric\nPower System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State Standardized\nInterconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection\nCustomer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $1,148,296.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible from Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating conditions.\nTherefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in effect, NYSEG\nreserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nQualifying Cost Share upgrade payments are non-refundable for the triggering/sharing project until a sharing project provides payment\nsuch that the utility has received payments of 100% of the triggering cost/payments equal to the pro-rata share of the Qualifying Upgrade.\nNYSEG is no longer accepting cost share payments for substation upgrades until 01/01/2024. If your cost share payment is due prior to\n01/01/2024 please email distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com for further instruction.\nPage 3 of 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21441\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n9/11/2023\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Kattleville\nTransformer Name 1\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 28,180\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 4,227\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 27171 / 3556 / 23615\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 2\nConnecting Feeder/Line 8104601\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 6,610\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 992\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 4.29 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 17351 / 3351 / 14000\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-599, P-130\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 3107 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 2399 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.1047 + j0.602 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.2391 + j0.9659 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne (1) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV UL1741 and IEEE1547 certified, 1500 kW (limited)\nPage 4 of 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21441\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n9/11/2023\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 106.92% of nominal, and is impacted by\nthe proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of voltage\non any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the generator\ninterconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not applicable\nfor switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of the\nmeter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7.

Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Unintentional Islanding\nDue to the significant risk of unintentional islanding it is required that Reclose Blocking be implemented\non the PCC reclsoer.\nPage 8 of 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21441\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n9/11/2023\n10. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained as\neffectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be\nrequired to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore,\nverification by the utility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in\norder to energize the generation site.\n11. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Equipment Withstand\nDue to the installation failing the Equipment Ratings Screen it is required that the breaker 42212 be\nreplaced with equipment that has a minimum interrupting capability of 9000 A.\n12. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Transmission\nTGFOV (59G) mitigation must be installed. 59G protection consists of (3) voltage XFMR's, microprocessor\nrelay, detailed engineering design, installation, commissioning and energization.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s\nfeasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric\nPower System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State Standardized\nInterconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection\nCustomer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $1,576,205.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by distribution planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating conditions.\nTherefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in effect, NYSEG\nreserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nPage 3 of 14\nInternal Use\n#\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21616\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 1\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/16/2023\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Peruville Tap\nTransformer Name N/A\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) N/A\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) N/A\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 10276 / 276 / 10000\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status N/A\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus N/A\nConnecting Feeder/Line 4303701\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 3,517\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 528\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 2.76 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) 0.73 miles\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Non-Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 10276 / 276 / 10000\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-5029, P-5\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 1958 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1213 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.2996 + j0.8854 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.7671 + j2.2529 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 4.8kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nTwo (2) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV, 2500 kW each (limited).\nPage 4 of 14\nInternal Use\n#\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21616\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 1\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/16/2023\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 107.56% of nominal, and is impacted by\nthe proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of voltage\non any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the generator\ninterconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not applicable\nfor switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of the\nmeter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7.

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $2,782,725.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions are\ntaken to prevent reliability violations. Due to generation ahead of this project in the queue, additional 5 MW of generation will cause\nthermal overload and high voltage violations. The mitigation options available to this project will depend on the mitigations selected\nby projects ahead in the queue.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nThe triggering amount for the transformer is $867,400.\nThe triggering amount for the reconductering is $ 248,400.\nThe triggering amount for the 3V0 protection is $117,894.\nPAGE 4 OF 16\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22419\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n1/22/2024\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Wallace\nTransformer Name 2\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 2,815\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 396\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 3975 / 75 / 3900\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 12.47\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 3,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 1\nConnecting Feeder/Line 5302240\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 2,284\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 343\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 12.47\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 3.4 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 3975 / 75 / 3900\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-334, P-2\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 1939 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1891 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.9581 + j2.2825 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.6472 + j2.4121 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 12.47kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nTwo (2) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV UL1741, 2500 kW each (limited).\nPAGE 5 OF 16\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22419\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n1/22/2024\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) PASS\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 104.52% of nominal, and is not impacted\nby the proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this\nlocation unless mitigating actions are taken to prevent reliability violations. Due to generation ahead\nof this project in the queue, additional 5 MW of generation will cause thermal overload and high\nvoltage violations. The mitigation options available to this project will depend on the mitigations\nselected by projects ahead in the queue. Options to mitigate are:\na. Reactive support: Flexible reactive support installed at 34.5 kV bus at Wallace Substation in\nthe range of -3/3 Mvar.+\nb. Simple Transmission Upgrade: Uprate the 34.5 kV circuit #536 between Hill Street and\nBennett Substations.\n7. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n8. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the NYSSIR\nSection I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$765,217.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating conditions, which are\ndescribed in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase\nin system size and/or design change is subject to the requirements of the NYSSIR.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #16149\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n7/23/2020\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation 15020T1\nTransformer Name 1\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 3,976\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 2,426\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 2507.5 / 157.5 / 2350\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 12.47\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 16,800\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 1502030\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 6,755\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 1,013\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 12.47\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 0.36 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 2370 / 20 / 2350\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-733, P-16\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 3730 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 4120 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.1408 + j1.2793 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.1558 + j0.8323 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 12.47kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\n13,923 PV module maufacturer by HANWHA with model # Q.PEAK L-G4.2 370.

Due to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained\nas effectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in NYSEG/RGE Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will\nbe required to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s\nfeasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $504,858.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions are\ntaken to prevent reliability violations. Due to generation ahead of this generator in the queue, additional 2.8 MW will cause thermal\nviolation. Options to mitigate this violation include (but are not limited to) are listed in Section 6.6.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nPAGE 3 OF 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22811\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n3/6/2024\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Langdon\nTransformer Name 3\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 37,467\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 1,646\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 24194 / 4194 / 20000\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 42,000\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status N/A\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 1\nConnecting Feeder/Line 8102702\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 11,613\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 1,742\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 4.75 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 24194 / 4194 / 20000\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-671, P-21\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 4070 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 2861 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.1099 + j0.4208 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.2622 + j0.8735 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne Sungrow SG3425UD-MV, limited to 2690 kW\nPAGE 4 OF 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22811\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n3/6/2024\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.82% of nominal, and is impacted by\nthe proposed DER.

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $1,443,095.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions are\ntaken to prevent reliability violations. The generation ahead of the Project increased voltage at the substation. The Project\nintroduced overvoltage violations under off-peak load conditions. Options to mitigate are listed in Section 6.6.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nThe triggering amount for the .67 mile of reconducting is $416,070.\nThe triggering amount for the 3V0 protection is $156,926.\nPAGE 3 OF 15\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #23177\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n4/8/2024\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Hampton Road\nTransformer Name 3\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 3,330\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 335\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 12.6 / 12.6 / 0\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 4.8\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 3,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 2\nConnecting Feeder/Line 5200989\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 2,590\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 389\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 4.80\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 1.11 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Non-Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 12.6 / 12.6 / 0\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-310, P-73\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 2496 Amps\nI Line to Line (LL) 2162 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 1.2927 + j4.6488 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) N/A\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 4.8kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne (1) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV inverter, limited to 2800 kVA maximum\nPAGE 4 OF 15\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #23177\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n4/8/2024\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.62% of nominal, and is impacted by\nthe proposed DER.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York\nState Standardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$594,267.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions\nare taken to prevent voltage violations. Please see section 6 for mitigation options.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase\nin system size and/or design change is subject to the requirements of the NYSSIR.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #16646\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/23/2020\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Harford\nTransformer Name N/A\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) N/A\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) N/A\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 11658 / 5 / 11653\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status N/A\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus N/A\nConnecting Feeder/Line 4304201\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 617\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 179\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI None\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 0.295 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 11658 / 5 / 11653\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-298, P-10\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 1612 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 926 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.2628 + j1.17495 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.93348 + j3.04651 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via None 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nFour (4) Ingecon brand, model 1245TL U B480, three-phase, 1.247MVA three-phase inverters.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #16646\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/23/2020\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 106.57% of nominal, and is impacted\nby the proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. Transmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location\nunless mitigating actions are taken to prevent voltage violations. Due to the approximately 16.5 MW\nof generation ahead of this project in the queue, an additional 4.988 MW can result in high voltage on\nthe transmission system when the substation is fed from its alternate source of South Owego.\nOptions to mitigate this violation include:\n1. Dynamic reactive support that would allow for adjustable power factor (study was done at\nunity).\n2. Complex transmission system upgrade. A SIS would be needed to identify the full scope of\nupgrades required.\n3. If generation ahead of this project exits the queue, that may free up capacity at Harford\nMills. Based on the current projects in the queue Harford Mills can support a maximum\ntotal of 10.5 MW of generation.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality. These include:\nControl is REQUIRED for the Source Regulation:\na. The newly-proposed 3-418A circuit tap regulators on circuit 4204301.\n8.

Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Ground Fault Detection\nMore information is required to pass this screen. The proposed generation system includes a neutral\nground reactor, the impedance and X/R ratio is needed to determine ground fault detection.\n14. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained\nas effectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in NYSEG/RGE Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be\nrequired to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore,\nverification by the utility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in\norder to energize the generation site.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #16646\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/23/2020\n7.0 CONCEPTUAL COST ESTIMATE\nThe following items are a good faith estimate for the scope and work required to interconnect the project estimated under rates and\nschedules in effect at the time of this study in accordance with the most recent version of the NYSSIR.\nPlanning Grade Estimate\nProject #16646\nScope:\nA.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York\nState Standardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$3,371,420.*\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by distribution planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nThe interconnection fails the Flicker analysis. It has the option to proceed to a Time-Series Analysis if the developer chooses to move\nforward with the project at its full output, or to determine an acceptable output value.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions are\ntaken to prevent voltage violations.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, RG&E reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Transmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location\nunless mitigating actions are taken to prevent voltage violations. Due to high levels of aggregate\ngeneration relative to load, concentrated on the most radial parts of long 34.5 kV circuits, this\nadditional generation can create high transmission system voltages during periods of day-time light\nload. Options to mitigate are:\nNon-unity power factor operation - Operation at a fixed 0.98 leading (absorbing VArs) will\na.\nmitigation the high voltage concerns on the transmission system.\nTransmission Reactive support - Installation of a rapid reactive support device at Station 189\nb.\nor 198 would be able to mitigate the high voltage conditions created by the project.\nQueue Position Change - If projects ahead in the queue at Stations 198 exit, primarily\nc.\n16257, additional capacity would become available at Station 189.\n7.

Project Description\nDelaware River Solar, LLC is applying to interconnect a 1.649 MW photovoltaic generating\nstation to be located at 760 Washington St in Ogden. The contact for the project is Pete\nDolgos of Delaware River Solar, LLC, (646) 998-6495, peter.dolgos@xzertaenergy.com.\nBecause this interconnection is 1.649 MW capacity, its interconnection requirements are\ngoverned by the New York State Standardized Interconnection Requirements and Application\nProcess for New Distributed Generators 5 MW or Less Connected in Parallel with Utility\nDistribution Systems (SIRs) and IEEE Std. 1547, IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed\nResources with Electric Power Systems (IEEE 1547).\nII. Planning\nDistribution Planning performed studies to determine if the Project can be interconnected to\nexisting 12.47 kV RGE distribution feeder #5101 out of substation 113 to comply with the\nrequirements contained in IEEE 1547, Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources\nwith Electric Power Systems.\nDistribution Planning Requirements and Conclusions:\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for\nthe loss of voltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the IPP\nfrom the utility at the generator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator\ncontrols must be either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted\nmicroprocessor controls that will handle reverse power flow and co-generation\nfunctionality. Based preliminary studies, the substation regulators should be set to \u2018co-\ngeneration\u2019 mode if it is a Siemen MJXL or MJ4A control. If it is an older M-2001C\nBeckwith control, it should be upgraded to an M-2001D unit and the \u2018DG\u2019 or \u2018auto\ndetermination\u2019 mode set. These include:\na. The substation Transformer is of LTC type, Voltage regulators located at GIS ID\n300185730 (CESIR 11432), GISID 300185949 (CESIR 10056), new regulators to be\nadded at GISIDs 300185677, and 310021548.\nPage 2 of 18\n3. Transmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed\ngeneration at this location on the transmission system.\n4. If the IPP cannot comply with the voltage regulation threshold criteria, install new line\nregulators on the utility-side of the PCC location. The new line circuit regulators shall be\nequipped with reverse power flow & co-generation functionality (Beckwith M2001-D).\n5. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the\nutility-side of the Primary Metered Service at the PCC.\n100 A Phase Pickup: 1-DT\n25 A Ground Pickup: 1-DT\nOne-shot to lockout\nNo reset time\nDirectionality must be enabled to trip in the forward direction only.\n6. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits\nwill require the customer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s\nPCC.\n7. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and\nis not applicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n8. Upgrade 336.4_AL_RG to 477 AAAC from substation to L-12034 P-112 approximately 3.2\nmiles.\n9. Bladed cutout's at L1839, P-1, P-24A, & P-60 were upgraded to SID switches under CESIR\n11834. In the event of CESIR 11834 cancellation, the equipment upgrade will be\nrequired under this application.\n10. The protection (Over Current coordination) aspect of the project will need to be\nreviewed by Corporate SP&C. Final settings will be provided by Corporate SP&C prior to\ninterconnection.\n11. Upgrade existing fused cutout at L1839, P26 to a recloser. Recloser required (minimum\nrating of 560Amps is required).\n12. Upgrade existing fused cutout at L12034, P113 to a recloser. Recloser (minimum ratio\nof 190Amps is required).\nPage 3 of 18\n13. The existing transmission circuit relaying will need to reviewed and verified by System\nEngineering in order to properly coordinate with the proposed downstream distribution\nprotective devices.\n14. Install 400Amp voltage regulator banks at GISIDs 300185677, and 310021548.\n15. Primary Distribution Interconnection/Transformer Connection:\nPrimary Distribution Line Interconnection to Primary Distribution Line\nConfiguration\nThree-phase, three-wire If a three-phase or single-phase generator, interconnection must be\nphase-to-phase\nThree-phase, four-wire If a three-phase (effectively grounded) or single-phase generator,\ninterconnection must be line-to-neutral\nIII. Interconnection Protection\nA. Information from the Customer\nThe Customer provided a three line diagram for the Project which does not include\nprotection settings.

The\ncustomer provided technical specifications for this equipment. The Ingecon Ingeteam\n1170TL U B450 inverter is listed on the New York State Type-Tested and Approved\nEquipment List.\n2. Three Phase Automatic Interrupting Device\nRecloser\nMV Pole Mounted Fused Disconnect\nSwitchboard Main Fuse\nSwitchboard Branch Circuit Breakers.\nPV System UL 1741 Inverters\n3. AC Disconnect Switch\nThe generator AC disconnect switch is labeled on the drawings. The Customer is\ninstalling a 15 kV 600A load break disconnect switch. The Customer needs to provide\nspecifications for the proposed switch. The AC disconnect must be an ''external,\nmanual, visible, gang-operated, load break disconnecting switch'' per SIR requirements.\nThe developer must submit the requisite information for the proposed disconnect\nswitch prior to installation.\n4. CTs and VTs\nNo information regarding the installation of CTs or VTs.\n5. Transformer\nThe proposed transformer that is being installed has a 12.47 kV Grounded Wye\nconnection on the high side in order to interconnect with the RGE distribution feeder.\nC. Protection Studies\n1. Voltage-Frequency\nThe proposed voltage and frequency settings for the inverters are NOT provided. The\nsettings need to be as follows:\nVoltage (% of Rated) Clearing Time (s)\nV < 50 0.16\nPage 5 of 18\n50 < V < 88 2.00\n110 < V < 120 1.00\nV > 120 0.16\nThe Customer will need to provide these to RGE for review and approval.\n2. Automatic Reclosing of the New Generation\nThe Customer is hereby reminded that any closing of the inverter to the utility system\nmust be delayed by at least 5 minutes following restoration of the utility system to a\nhealthy voltage and frequency.\n3. Grounding Studies\nThe Coefficient of Grounding (COG) for the installation has been calculated to be 0.75.\nThe COG is less than 0.8, so the system is effectively grounded.\n4. Short Circuit Studies\nAs a result of the installation, the short circuit current on the substation 113 12.47 kV\nbus increases as follows:\nPage 6 of 18\nSystem with\nPresent System New Generation\nAdded\n3ph short circuit current (A) 2113 2201\n1ph-gnd short circuit current (A) 1317 1318\nNo interrupting devices on the RGE electrical system are over duty as a result of the\nadditional source of short circuit current.\n5. Protection Coverage\nThe new generation does not affect protection coverage of the protective relays on the\nfeeder terminal at RGE substation 113.\n6. Switching to Other Sources\nThe new generation must be disconnected from the electrical system if it is switched to\nthe adjacent feeders during maintenance or system emergencies. The electrical\nparameters of the adjacent feeders (impedance, grounding, system protection) would\nbe different than those of the interconnecting feeder, and the impact of the generation\non the adjacent feeders are not known. For these operating scenarios, the generation\nwould be required to be disconnected from the electrical system until the electrical\nsystem is returned to normal configuration.\n7. Ferroresonance\nFerroresonant over-voltages have not been found to be a problem for inverters of the\nsame technology interconnected to the same distribution feeder.\n8. Anti \u2013 Islanding\nInverter must be in compliance with UL1741 and the complete system must comply with\nthe National Electric Safety Code, the National Electric Code and the IEEE 1547 standard.\nEach individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for\nthe loss of voltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the IPP\nfrom the utility at the generator interconnection and must be verified at checkout. Anti-\nislanding to be certified by PE and witness tested by the utility.\nPage 7 of 18\nA significant risk of unintentional islanding exists and additional study is required. The\nstudy must be funded by the developer and will be conducted outside the CESIR\ntimeline. As an option to the additional study, the developer can have the utility install\na bi-directional recloser at the PCC with a block reclose protection scheme activated.\nThe cost for this recloser will be included in the cost estimate section of this report.\n9. Monitoring Specific Requirements\nThese values represent the most basic monitoring components that can provide\nsituational awareness at the PCC. Additional monitoring points may be needed per\nindividual utility requirements. Monitoring data shall be accessible remotely by the use\nof communications technology per the utility\u2019s protocols.\nThe minimum required data values at the point of common coupling (PCC) are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Per phase voltage and current\n\u2022 Three phase values for real (watts) and reactive (VARs) power\n\u2022 Power factor\n10. Metering\nRGE will install a Primary revenue meter and associated instrument transformers for\nthe customer\u2019s Primary service. The estimated cost for the RGE equipment and\ninstallation will be included in the estimate section of the report.\nPage 8 of 18\nIV.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York\nState Standardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$374,761.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase\nin system size and/or design change is subject to the requirements of the NYSSIR.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #17457\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 1\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/4/2021\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Axtell Rd\nTransformer Name 2\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 8,400\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 1,466\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 4387 / 394 / 3993\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 18,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 2307011\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 4,470\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 671\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 1.965 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 4134 / 141 / 3993\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-264, P-6-2\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 2186 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 2183 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.1075 + j0.771 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.1825 + j0.7375 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nFour (4) Ingecon SUN PowerMax B Series IS 1245UTL U B480 inverters, rated at 1247 kVA each.

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $255,865.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by distribution planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nNYSEG is no longer accepting cost share payments for substation upgrades until 01/01/2024. If your cost share payment is due prior to\n01/01/2024 please email distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com for further instruction.\nThe triggering amount for your cost share eligible substation upgrade is $169,014.\nPage 3 of 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21556\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n9/22/2023\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Sleight Rd\nTransformer Name N/A\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) N/A\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) N/A\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 38961 / 202 / 38759\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus N/A\nConnecting Feeder/Line 4207946\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 5,194\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 779\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 1.9493 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 13550 / 124 / 13426\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-546, P-47\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 6615 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 5250 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.0513 + j0.3425 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.0988 + j0.435 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne (1) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV, 2200 kW (limited)\nPage 4 of 13\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21556\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n9/22/2023\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) PASS\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.74% of nominal, and is not impacted\nby the proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality.\n8. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained as\neffectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as identified\nin AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be required to\nbe submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly identifying the\nrevision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the proposed\ninterconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of islanding\n(intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore, verification by the\nutility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in order to energize the\ngeneration site.\n9. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Transmission\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage \u2013 Transmission System Fault screen it is required that 59N\nrelaying be installed.

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $9,946,913.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by distribution planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality. These include:\nControl is REQUIRED for the Source Regulation:\na. Substation transformer LTC 34.5/12.47 kV\n8.

Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained as\neffectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as identified\nin AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be required to\nbe submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly identifying the\nrevision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the proposed\ninterconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of islanding\n(intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore, verification by the\nutility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in order to energize the\ngeneration site.\nPAGE 9 OF 14\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #21047\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n7/26/2023\n7.0 Smart Inverter Settings\nThe following provides Smart Inverter Settings - AVGDFS\nInverter Mode: Vars precedence over Watts\nInverter Ratings\nKVA rating: 6000\nKW rating: 5000\nKVAR rating: 6000\nDefault Settings: (These are the default settings to be used as reference.

The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be\nrequired to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York\nState Standardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$652,317*.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\n*Transmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions\nare taken to prevent voltage violations. Please see section 6 for mitigation options.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase\nin system size and/or design change is subject to the requirements of the NYSSIR.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #17215\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/17/2021\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Harford\nTransformer Name N/A\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) N/A\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) N/A\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 9981 / 5 / 9976\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status N/A\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus N/A\nConnecting Feeder/Line 4304201\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 600\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 90\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 0.022 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 9981 / 5 / 9976\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-297, P-1A\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 1612 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 944 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.2463 + j1.1513 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.8993 + j2.9765 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne (1) Ingeteam IS 1500TL U B578 inverter rated at 1502 kVA, and one (1) 2.00 MVA pad-mounted\n34.5/0.578kV Yg/Y transformer.\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #17215\nInterconnected Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/17/2021\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.96% of nominal, and is impacted\nby the proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. Transmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location\nunless mitigating actions are taken to prevent voltage violations. In the event that Harford Mills\nSubstation is being fed from Binghamton instead of Dryden Substation there is a potential for high\nvoltages on the transmission system. Options to mitigate this violation include:\na. Operation at a fixed power factor may be possible depending on the mitigation selected by\ngeneration ahead in the queue (CESIR #17023 and CESIR #17214).\nb. Reactive support installed on the transmission system \u2013 equipment that would allow for a\nreactive power absorption in the range of 0-1 MVAr in response to transmission system\nvoltages. (If this option is chosen then the cost estimate in section 7.0 would be updated.)\nc. Complex transmission system upgrade \u2013 initial reviews did not identify any additional\nsimple solutions, so a more in-depth study would be required to determine the scope of an\nupgrade that would support the full generation capacity proposed at this site. (Additional\nfunding and time would be required to perform this more in-depth study.)\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must\nbe either already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality.

The intent of this report is to assess\nthis project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the\nCompany\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York\nState Standardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is\n$398,812.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by distribution planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase\nin system size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer.\nAn increase in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nPage 3 of 12\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #19775\nInterconnect Review\nRevision\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/16/2022\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Kattleville\nTransformer Name N/A\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) N/A\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) N/A\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 22868 / 3509 / 19359\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) N/A\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus N/A\nConnecting Feeder/Line 8104601\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 6,560\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 984\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 3.099 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 5322 / 3313 / 2009\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-599, P-162\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 3303 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 2786 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.0849 + j0.5392 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.1789 + j0.7826 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nTwo (2) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV inverters, limited to 2500 kW each.\nPage 4 of 12\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #19775\nInterconnect Review\nRevision\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/16/2022\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) PASS\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 106.73% of nominal, and is not\nimpacted by the proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\nThe Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\n2.\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n7. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must be\neither already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality.\n8. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Unintentional Islanding\nDue to the significant risk of unintentional islanding reclosed blocking is recommended.\n9. Failure(s) Addressed: SPC: Overvoltage \u2013 Distribution\nDue to the installation failing the Overvoltage-Distribution System Fault and Effective Grounding\nScreens the project must be revised such that if the generation site is islanded from the utility the\nsystem from the Point Of Interconnection into and through the generation equipment is maintained\nas effectively grounded. The interconnection is required to meet the grounding requirements as\nidentified in AVANGRID Bulletin 86-01 section 6.2.2.2 Grounding. A PE stamped revised 3 Line will be\nrequired to be submitted to the Distributedgenerationadmin@avangrid.com mailbox clearly\nidentifying the revision(s) made to meet the effective grounding requirements. It is vital that the\nproposed interconnection maintain an effectively grounded system such that during any case of\nislanding (intentional or not), the circuit (and load) remains effectively grounded. Therefore,\nverification by the utility of the system meeting the effective grounding requirements is necessary in\norder to energize the generation site.\nPage 8 of 12\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #19775\nInterconnect Review\nRevision\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n11/16/2022\n10.

This upgrade will result in an incremental hosting capacity amount of 19.132\nMW and the total cost is $654,777. Please note that under the Cost Sharing 2.0 process, the mobilization\nthreshold for substation Transformer Bank upgrades is upon payment of 75% of the Qualifying Upgrade\nCost by the Triggering Project and Sharing Project(s). For other Qualifying Substation Upgrades, the\nmobilization threshold is 25% of the Qualifying Upgrade Cost. Any remaining reconciliation for\nQualifying Upgrade Cost will occur pursuant to Section I-C of the SIR. Qualifying Upgrade Costs are non-\nrefundable until another Sharing Project provides payment such that the utility has received payments\nequal to the pro-rata share of the Qualifying Upgrade.\nDeveloper is required to pay all actual costs for system upgrades and interconnection facilities.\nNotes:\n1.) These estimated costs are based upon the results of this study and are subject to change. All costs\nanticipated to be incurred by the Company are listed.\n2.) The Company will reconcile actual charges upon project completion and the Interconnection Customer\nwill be responsible for all final charges, which may be higher or lower than estimated according to the\nNYSSIR I.C step 11.\n3.)

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $400,370.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating conditions, which are\ndescribed in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning does not have any concerns with the installation of this proposed generation at this location.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nPAGE 3 OF 12\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22278\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/11/2023\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Hamilton Rd\nTransformer Name 1\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 23,010\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 3,159\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 5053 / 53 / 5000\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 18,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status N/A\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 1\nConnecting Feeder/Line 4402901\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 23,010\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 3,452\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 34.50\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 2.91 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 5053 / 53 / 5000\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-911, P-1\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 2331 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1994 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 0.0819 + j0.7345 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 0.2228 + j1.0412 PU\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 34.5kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne Sungrow SG3425UD-MV, 2500 kVA (limited).\nPAGE 4 OF 12\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #22278\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n12/11/2023\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) PASS\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.89% of nominal, and is not impacted\nby the proposed DER.

The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s\nElectric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the New York State\nStandardized Interconnection Requirements (NYSSIR) Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the Interconnection Customer is $1,443,095.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible by Distribution Planning with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nTransmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location unless mitigating actions are\ntaken to prevent reliability violations. The generation ahead of the Project increased voltage at the substation. The Project\nintroduced overvoltage violations under off-peak load conditions. Options to mitigate are listed in Section 6.6.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit during normal Utility operating\nconditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service, or if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in\neffect, NYSEG reserves the right to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection has been studied. Any increase in\nsystem size and/or design change is subject to a new study and costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An\nincrease in system size may also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nThe triggering amount for the .67 mile of reconducting is $416,070.\nThe triggering amount for the 3V0 protection is $156,926.\nPAGE 3 OF 15\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #23177\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n4/8/2024\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Hampton Road\nTransformer Name 3\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 3,330\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) N/A\nMinimum Daytime Load (kVA) 335\nGeneration: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 12.6 / 12.6 / 0\nContingency Condition Generation: T/C/Q (kVA) N/A\nSupply Voltage (kV) 4.8\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 3,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status not installed\nBus Tie none\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 2\nConnecting Feeder/Line 5200989\nPeak Load on Feeder (kVA) 2,590\nMinimum Daytime Load on Feeder (kVA) 389\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 4.80\nLine Phasing at POI Three-Phase\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 1.11 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-Phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Non-Effective\nOther Generation: Total/Connected/Queued (kVA) 12.6 / 12.6 / 0\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System\nUpgrades described in Section 6\nInterconnection Customer POI Location L-310, P-73\nI 3-Phase (3LLL) 2496 Amps\nI Line to Line (LL) 2162 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 1.2927 + j4.6488 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) N/A\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new Primary Metered Service connection.\nThis location is presently served via Three-Phase 4.8kV.\nThe proposed generating system consists of :\nOne (1) Sungrow SG3425UD-MV inverter, limited to 2800 kVA maximum\nPAGE 4 OF 15\nCoordinated Electric System\nDER #23177\nInterconnect Review\nRevision 0\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR\n4/8/2024\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) FAIL\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 105.62% of nominal, and is impacted by\nthe proposed DER.

This\nincluded any required EPS equipment upgrades. Where scope items are identified, associated labor, equipment rentals and indirect\nproject support functions (such as engineering and project management) are intended and implied.\n1. Each individual PCC location must have the ability to trip offline within 2.0 seconds for the loss of\nvoltage on any one individual phase in order to electrically isolate the DER from the utility at the\ngenerator interconnection and must be verified at checkout.\n2. The Interconnection Customer is required to comply with the utility\u2019s voltage threshold criteria while\noperating the generating system. If, after interconnection, the Interconnection Customer cannot meet\nthis requirement the Company reserves the right to disconnect the generation and install voltage\nregulators on the utility side of the Point Of Common Coupling at the Interconnection Customer\u2019s\nexpense.\n3. Any potential manual or automatic switching schemes with other distribution circuits will require the\ncustomer to disconnect from the distribution circuit at the customer\u2019s PCC.\n4. Protection & coordination is based on only the system-normal circuit configuration, and is not\napplicable for switching scenarios and ties with other distribution circuits.\n5. The requirements for Remote Crediting, or Community Distributed Generation billing are that an hourly\ninterval MV-90 meter be installed which has remote access via a dial-up telephone circuit known as a\nland line. The installation of the land line is the responsibility of the customer, and the installation of\nthe meter is the responsibility of the utility.\n6. Transmission Planning cannot recommend the installation of this proposed generation at this location\nunless mitigating actions are taken to prevent reliability violations. The generation ahead of the\nProject increased voltage at the substation. The Project introduced overvoltage violations under off-\npeak load conditions. Options to mitigate are:\na. Non-Unity Power Factor: Operating the project at non-unity power factor 0.98 (absorbing\nVAR) would mitigate overvoltage at substation Hampton Rd.\nb. Transmission Reactive Support: Installing a Dynamic VAR (D-VAR) support or a similar\ndevice rated 1 MVAR (absorbing VAR) at Substation Hampton Rd would resolve the voltage\nimpacts under off-peak condition.\n7. Install a new microprocessor-controlled line recloser equipped with directionality on the utility-side of\nthe primary-metered service at the PCC.\n8. Any circuit tap, substation, or distribution line regulators, and substation LTC/regulator controls must be\neither already equipped with or changed out to retrofitted microprocessor controls that will handle\nreverse power flow and co-generation functionality. These include:\nControl is REQUIRED for the Source Regulation:\na. Circuit 5200989 Source Bus Regulator at the substation\n9.

(\u201cCHGE\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d) interconnection study based on the proposed interconnection and design\nsubmittal from the Interconnection Customer in accordance with the Company Interconnection\nRequirements for Distributed Energy Resources Connected in Parallel with the CHGE Electrical\nDelivery System, IEEE Standard 1547-2018 (\u201cIEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed\nResources with Electric Power Systems\u201d), and \u201cNew York State Standardized Interconnection\nRequirements and Application Process for New Distributed Generators 5 MW or Less Connected\nin Parallel with Utility Distribution Systems\u201d (NYSSIR). The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine\ninterconnection scope and installation requirements, and determine costs associated with\ninterconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric Power\nSystem (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the\nNYSSIR Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the\nInterconnection Customer is $5,327,043\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible with modifications to the existing Company EPS\nand operating conditions, which are described in detail in the body of this study.\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Grimley Road\nTransformer Name (list multiple where normally tied to common bus) Transformer #1\nTransformer Peak Load (kW) 2,344\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) (as applicable) n/a\nDaytime Light Load (kW) 337\nGeneration: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 5,150; 134; 15\nContingency Condition Generation: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead\n(kW) n/a\nSupply Voltage (kV) 13.8\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 3,750\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status Installed\nBus Tie Open\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 1\n3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 3095\nPeak Load on feeder (kW) 2,344\nDaytime Light Load on Feeder (kW) 337\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 2.4\nLine Phasing at POI 1\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 4.17 mile(s)\nDistance from POI to nearest 3-phase (if applicable) 1.43 mile(s)\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 5,150; 134; 15\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System Upgrades\nDescribed in Section 6\nPole K42518,\nInterconnection Customer POI Location Camp Road\nI 3-phase (3LLL) 1,323 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1,002 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA base) 2.04+j6.33 Ohms\nZ0 (100 MVA base) 4.16+j11.81 Ohms\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new primary service connection with Project No.\nCH-16681.\nThe proposed project POI is on Feeder 3095 supplied from Grimley Road Substation\nTransformer #1. The POI is located approximately 4.17 miles from the substation. The POI is on\nsingle-phase 2.4 kV. The interconnection includes 118.62 feet of 250 kcmil OH conductor and\n909.63 feet of 500 kcmil Al 15kV UG cable. The PV units are interconnected to the low side (600 V\nwye) of the two customer-owned 3,425 kVA interconnection transformers. Approximately 1.43\nmiles of single-phase 2.4 kV will need to be reconductored to three-phase 336 ACSR 13.2 kV to\nfacilitate the interconnection.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\uf0b7 A total of 12,480 LONGI LR5-72HBD 545M 545 W PV modules\n\uf0b7 Two SUNGROW SG 3425 UD-MV 3,425 kW solar inverters (de-rated to 2,500 kW),\ntotaling 5,000 kW at 600 Vac output.\n(Use Central Hudson settings:\nhttps://cenhuddg.powerclerk.com/Library/Public/User_Notifications/CenHud_Smart_Inv\nerter_Settings_Required_20230101.pdf )\n\uf0b7 Two, three-phase 3,425 kVA, 600 V wye \u2013 13.2 kV wye grounded, step-up transformers\nwith 5.84% impedance and X/R = 11.41\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nThe analysis was run at the rated project size in normal system configuration connected to the\nFeeder 3095. The following table shows the impact study results of the proposed 5,000 kW\nsystem at unity power factor interconnecting to Central Hudson\u2019s distribution system.\n4\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage - Primary <105% (ANSI C84.1) Fail\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the feeder is greater\nthan 105% of nominal. The overvoltage will be mitigated by applying the mitigation mentioned in\nSection 6.0.\nVoltage Overvoltage - Project Inverters <105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the project inverters\nis 100.88% of nominal.\nVoltage Undervoltage >95% (ANSI C84.1) Fail\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the minimum voltage as modeled on the feeder is less than\n95% of nominal.\nVoltage Substation Regulation for Reverse <100% minimum load criteria Fail\nPower\nThe total proposed generation on Transformer #1, including this project and any projects ahead in\nqueue, is 5.04 MW. The total minimum load on this transformer is 0.34 MW. Therefore, the generation\nto load ratio is 1,494.60%. Reverse flow is expected through the Grimley Road Substation Transformer\n#1 LTC due to the interconnection of the proposed project. Grimley Substation Transformer #1 LTC\ncontrol needs to be upgraded to handle reverse power flow.\nVoltage Feeder Regulation for Reverse <100% minimum load to Fail\nPower generation ratio\nThe total proposed generation on Feeder 3095, including this project and any projects ahead in queue,\nis 5.04 MW. The total minimum load on this feeder is 0.34 MW. Therefore, the generation to load ratio\nis 1,495%. Reverse flow is expected through circuit 3095 due to the interconnection of the proposed\nproject. Line regulators K40608 and K42425 are installed between substation breaker and POI.

The POI is located approximately 2.44 miles from the substation. The POI is on\nthree-phase 13.2 kV. The interconnection includes 1518 feet of 336 AA WR OH conductor, 120\nfeet of 336 AA WR OH conductor, and 1720.28 feet of 2/0 Al UG cable. The PV units are\ninterconnected to the low side (600 V wye-Ungrounded) of the 3.42 MVA customer installed and\nmanaged pad-mounted transformer. It is necessary to extend the available 3 phase 13.2kV\nutility network from pole #K45114 to the new POI.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\uf0b7 A total of 5,408 LR5-72HBD 535M PV modules\n\uf0b7 One SG 3425 UD-MV SUNGROW 2500 kVA solar inverters at 600 Vac output\n\uf0b7 One, three-phase 3.42 MVA, 600 V wye - 13.2 kV wye grounded, step-up transformer with\n5% impedance and 4 X/R ratio\n4\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nThe analysis was run at the rated project size in normal system configuration connected to\nFeeder 3096. The following table shows the impact study results of the proposed 2,500 kW\nsystem at unity power factor interconnecting to Central Hudson\u2019s distribution system.\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage \u2010 Primary <105% (ANSI C84.1) Fail\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the feeder is\n106.12% of nominal. The overvoltage will be mitigated by applying the mitigation mentioned in\nSection 6.0.\nVoltage Overvoltage \u2010 Project Inverters <105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, there were no overvoltage violations observed at the\nproject inverter.\nVoltage Undervoltage >95% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, there were no undervoltage violations observed at the\nFeeder.\nVoltage Substation Regulation for Reverse <100% minimum load criteria Fail\nPower\nThe total proposed generation on Transformer #2, including this project and any projects ahead in\nqueue, is 6.97 MW. The total minimum load on this Transformer is 0.500 MW. Therefore, the\ngeneration to load ratio is 1394%. Reverse flow is expected through Grimley Road Substation\nTransformer #2.

(\u201cCHGE\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d) interconnection study based on the proposed interconnection and design\nsubmittal from the Interconnection Customer in accordance with the Company Interconnection\nRequirements for Distributed Energy Resources Connected in Parallel with the CHGE Electrical\nDelivery System, IEEE Standard 1547-2018 (\u201cIEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed\nResources with Electric Power Systems\u201d), and \u201cNew York State Standardized Interconnection\nRequirements and Application Process for New Distributed Generators 5 MW or Less Connected\nin Parallel with Utility Distribution Systems\u201d (NYSSIR). The intent of this report is to assess this\nproject\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine\ninterconnection scope and installation requirements, and determine costs associated with\ninterconnecting the Interconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric Power\nSystem (EPS). This Coordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the\nNYSSIR Section I.C Step 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the\nInterconnection Customer is $401,936.50 for Option 1 and $1,835,443.70 for Option 2.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible with modifications to the existing Company EPS\nand operating conditions, which are described in detail in the body of this study.\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Neversink\nTransformer Name (list multiple where normally tied to common bus) Transformer #3\nTransformer Peak Load (kW) 3,639\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) (as applicable) n/a\nDaytime Light Load (kW) 914\nGeneration: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 4643; 743; 0\nContingency Condition Generation: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead\n(kW) n/a\nSupply Voltage (kV) 13.8\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 4,500\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation No\nTransmission GFOV Status Installed\nBus Tie Open\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 1\n3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 3091\nPeak Load on feeder (kW) 3,639\nDaytime Light Load on Feeder (kW) 914\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 13.2\nLine Phasing at POI 1\nCircuit distance from POI to substation 0.83 mi\nDistance from POI to nearest 3-phase (if applicable) 0.36 mi\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 4,643; 743; 0\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI with System Upgrades\nDescribed in Section 6\nPole K72807,\nInterconnection Customer POI Location Moore Hill Road\nI 3-phase (3LLL) 1,002 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 965 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA base) 1.03 + j8.31 Ohms\nZ0 (100 MVA base) 1.41 + j9.15 Ohms\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new primary service connection with Project No.\nCH-14479.\nThe proposed project POI is on Feeder 3091 supplied from Neversink Substation Transformer #3.\nThe POI is located approximately 0.83 miles from the substation. The POI is on single-phase\n7.62 kV. The interconnection includes 178 feet of #250 KCMIL OH conductor, 3712 feet of 3/0\nAWG UG and 100 feet of 3/0 AWG UG cable. The PV units are interconnected to the low side\n(600 V wye grounded) of the two customer-owned 3,425 kVA interconnection transformers. The\nsingle-phase 7.62 kV area of 0.36 miles needs to be reconductored to three-phase 336 ACSR\n13.2 kV to facilitate the interconnection.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\u2022 A total of 8,320 Longi LR5-72HBD 535 W PV modules\n\u2022 Two Sungrow SG3425UD-MV 3,425 kW (limited to 1,950 kW) solar inverters, totaling\n3,900 kW at 600 Vac output\n\u2022 Two, three-phase 3,425 kVA, 600 V wye grounded \u2013 13.2 kV wye grounded, step-up\ntransformers with 5.84% impedance and X/R=11.41\n\u2022 One three-phase 149 kVA with X/R=4 grounding transformer\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nThe analysis was run at the rated project size in normal system configuration connected to the\nFeeder 3091. The following table shows the impact study results of the proposed 3,900 kW\nsystem at unity power factor interconnecting to Central Hudson\u2019s distribution system.\n4\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage - Primary <105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the feeder is less than\n105% of nominal.\nVoltage Overvoltage - Project Inverters <105% (ANSI C84.1) Fail\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the project inverters\nis 106.60% of nominal. The overvoltage at the project inverters will be mitigated by applying the\nmitigation mentioned in Section 6.0.\nVoltage Undervoltage >95% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the minimum voltage as modeled on the feeder is 96.37%\nof nominal.\nVoltage Substation Regulation for Reverse <100% minimum load criteria Fail\nPower\nThe total proposed generation on Transformer #3, including this project and any projects ahead in\nqueue, is 3.95 MW. The total minimum load on this transformer is 0.91 MW. Therefore, the generation\nto load ratio is 432%. Reverse flow is expected through Neversink Substation Transformer #3 cause of\nproposed project online.\nVoltage Feeder Regulation for Reverse <100% minimum load to Fail\nPower generation ratio\nThe total proposed generation on Feeder 3091, including this project and any projects ahead in queue,\nis 3.95 MW. The total minimum load on this feeder is 0.91 MW. Therefore, the generation to load ratio\nis 432%. Reverse flow is expected through circuit 3091 cause of the proposed project online. There is\nno line regulator between substation and POI.\nVoltage Fluctuation <3% steady state from Pass\nproposed generation on\nfeeder\nThe maximum resulting voltage fluctuation at the POI location is 2.93% due to the proposed\ngeneration output stepping from 100% to 0%.\nVoltage Fluctuation <5% steady state from Fail\naggregate DER on substation\nbus\nThe maximum resulting voltage fluctuation at the feeder location is 6.77% due to all generation output\nstepping from 100% to 0%. The voltage fluctuation will be mitigated by applying the mitigation\nmentioned in Section 6.0.\nVoltage Fluctuation Regulator tap movement Fail\nexceeds 1 position,\ngeneration change of 75% of\nnameplate rating does not\nresult in voltage change >\u00bd\nthe bandwidth of any feeder\nvoltage regulating device.\nThe steady state load flow results show that the Neversink Substation 3091 regulator and the\ndistribution line regulators K11556 and K41714 will have excessive tap movement with the proposed\ngeneration online. There is a voltage change at Neversink Substation 3091 regulator and the line\nregulators 193798, K11556, K11557, K11560, K41714, and k57914 >\u00bd the bandwidth of the voltage\nregulating device. The tap movement and voltage change issue will be mitigated by applying the\nmitigation mentioned in Section 6.0.\n5\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Flicker Screen H Flicker Fail\nE = 0.350. Pst at POI = 1.326 at a generation output stepping from 100%-0%. The voltage flicker will\nPst\nbe mitigated by applying the mitigation mentioned in Section 6.0.\nEquipment Thermal (continuous current) <100% thermal limits Fail\nRatings assuming no load\nThere is one protective device between the substation breaker and POI: one fused cutout bank.\nThe loading on fuse 100801 exceeds its current thermal rating with the proposed project online.\nThere are no thermal violations at overhead or underground line sections with the proposed\ngeneration online.\nThe thermal violation on fuse 100801 will be mitigated by applying the mitigation mentioned in\nSection 6.0.\nEquipment Withstand (fault current) <90% withstand limits Pass\nRatings\nProtection Unintentional Islanding Unintentional Islanding Fail\nDocument & Company\nGuidelines\nThe subject generator is 3.9 MW solar PV system. The total interconnection of 4.643 MW does exceed\nthe 2/3 of the minimum feeder loading criteria, as the generation to minimum load ratio is 288%. The\nproposed interconnection also fails the criteria where the feeder power factor is higher than 0.99 (lag\nor lead) for an extended period of time. Therefore, reclose block is required.\nProtection Protective device coordination Company Guidelines Pass\nT here is one protective device between the substation breaker and POI: one fused cutout bank.\nProtection Fault Sensitivity Rated capabilities of EPS Fail\nequipment\nThe proposed interconnection causes more than 10% fault contribution.\nProtection Ground Fault Detection Reduction of reach >10% (by Pass\nUtility)\nThe Interconnection Customer has proposed one 149 kVA grounding transformer at the customer side\nof the interconnecting transformer. Central Hudson has determined that the grounding transformer\nshall be removed from the design.\nProtection Overvoltage - Distribution System <125% voltage rise Pass\nFault\nWith subject generator interconnected, the modeled voltage rise on the unfaulted phases of the\nsystem is <125% .\nProtection Effective Grounding 0<R0/X1<1 Pass\n0<X0/X1<3\nWith subject generators interconnected, the modeled R0/X1 is 0.16949 and X0/X1 is 0.79678.\nSCADA Required EMS Visibility for Monitoring & Control Yes\nGeneration Sources Requirements\nThe 3.9 MW subject generator triggers the requirement for SCADA reporting to the Utility via the use\nof an electronic recloser at the PCC.\n6\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nOther Open-Phase Protection Pass\n6.0 MITIGATIONS FOR SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS FAILURES\nThe detail below is intended to provide sufficient information and clarity to give the Interconnection\nCustomer an understanding of the relationship of costs and scope associated with the DER\ninterconnection and the system modifications due to the DER impact.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s feasibility,\ndetermine its impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope\nand installation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This\nCoordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the NYSSIR Section I.C\nStep 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection Customer\u2019s\ninstallation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the\nInterconnection Customer is $176,367.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible at a reduced output of 4.20 MW with modifications\nto the existing Company EPS and operating conditions, which are described in detail in the body\nof this Study.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit\nduring normal Utility operating conditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service,\nor if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in effect National Grid reserves the\nright to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection\nhas been studied. Any increase in system size and/or design change is subject to a new study\nand costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An increase in system size\nmay also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nDoc. #267494\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 4 of 11\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 4/27/2020\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Clinton 604\nTransformer Name TB1\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 6095\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kVA) (as applicable) 1344\n24Hr Light Load (kVA) 2383\nGeneration: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 281.02, 281.02, 0\nContingency Condition Generation: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead\n225.27, 225.27, 0\n(kW)\nSupply Voltage (kV) 46/13.2\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 10500\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status Not Installed\nBus Tie Open\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 60454\nPeak Load on feeder (kVA) 2299\nDaytime Light Load on Feeder (kVA) 540\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 13.2\nLine Phasing at POI 3\nCircuit Distance from POI to Substation 0.54 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-phase, (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation No\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nGeneration: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead(kW) 49.98, 49.98, 0\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI\nInterconnection Customer POI Location Pole 39, Kirkland Ave\nI 3-phase (3LLL) 3103 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 3218 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA base) 0.2666 + j1.5278 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA base) 0.3596 + j1.3417 PU\n1 The total value referenced here includes the subject generator, connected generation and\ngeneration that is queued ahead.\nDoc. #267494\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 5 of 11\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 4/27/2020\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new primary service connection with Account No.\n2554020014.\nThis location is presently served via the Company\u2019s 13.2kV radial distribution feeder 60454 from\nClinton 604 substation.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\u2022 Two (2) 2,500 kVA Sungrow SC2500U-MV inverters with a generation total of 5,000\nkVA.\n\u2022 Two (2) 2,500 kVA, 550V/13.2kV dellta/wye-grounded step-up transformers Z=6.5%,\nX/R=7.5.\n\u2022 One (1) Neutral Grounding Reactor Z=6.2\u03a9 \u00b1 10%, I=43.7A.\n\u2022 Gang Operated Air-Break Switch\n\u2022 Customer Owned Meter\n\u2022 Primary Utility Meter\n\u2022 Customer Owned Recloser\n\u2022 Gang Operated Generator Loadbreak Switch\nDoc. #267494\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 6 of 11\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 4/27/2020\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage < 105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nTo mitigate flicker issues, the subject generator must reduce output to 4.2 MW.

Therefore, the following system upgrades are required:\nNational Grid Protection and Control package (e.g. the PCC Recloser)\nProtection Protective device coordination Company Guidelines Fail\nThe DG Interconnection Customer has proposed a recloser for use as primary service protection. This\nprotective device is shown in the proper location on their submitted line diagrams. There is no\nsecondary service protection in the form of a fuse so both instantaneous and time curve overcurrent\nsettings will need to be provided in this recloser, in addition to ESB-756B required Power Quality\nfunctions (27, 59 and 81). The DG Interconnection Customer proposed preliminary settings for this\nrecloser.\nThe DG Interconnection Customer shall submit formal specifications, curves, and/or relay settings for\nreview and approval by National Grid to ensure proper coordination, correct function types, etc. if the\nproject moves forward. Recloser files will be required in their native format (SEL AcSELerator, Cooper\nProview, etc.) when submitted.\nProtection Fault Sensitivity Rated capabilities of EPS Pass\nequipment\nOf the currently active protectives devices (line reclosers, Station breaker relays) on this portion of\nthe system, none were impacted negatively by the addition of this Interconnection.\nProtection Ground Fault Detection Reduction of Reach Fail\nThe DG Interconnection Customer has proposed two (2) 2.5 MVA Yg/\u0394 GSUs with Z = 6.50 % and X/R =\n7.50. The Customer has proposed TR-1 and TR-2 sharing a single common neutral grounding reactor\nsized. The DG Interconnection customer did not provide preliminary specifications for this neutral\ngrounding reactor. Analysis was performed with this non-standard configuration and it is not feasible\nfor this DG Interconnection.\nThe DG Interconnection Customer shall provide separate 11.00 \u03a9 neutral grounding reactors for each\nYg/\u0394 GSU. With these neutral grounding reactors in service, the DG Interconnection Customer will\ncontribute approximately 112 A of 3I0 current to remote bolted line to ground faults and 388 A to\nfaults at the PCC.\nProtection Overvoltage - Transmission System Company 3V0 criteria Fail\nFault\nDoc. #267494\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 8 of 11\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 4/27/2020\nThe interconnection of distributed generation facilities to National Grid distribution substations can\nresult in conditions whereby line-to-ground faults on the transmission system could go undetected. This\nscenario was analyzed for the proposed interconnection to determine if the addition of the subject\ngenerator meets the Company\u2019s criteria for requiring transmission system line-to-ground fault\nprotection.\nThe existing station protection schemes were reviewed, and analysis performed, and it has been\ndetermined that the addition of this DG Interconnection triggers the requirement of additional\ntransmission system ground fault protection. Therefore, the following system upgrades are required:\nAn additional 3V protection scheme is required to mitigate the transmission system line-to-ground\n0\nfault condition.\nProtection Overvoltage - Distribution System < 125 % voltage rise Pass\nFault\nWith subject generator interconnected the maximum modeled voltage rise on the unfaulted phases\nof the system is 120.6%.\nProtection Effective Grounding R0/X1 \u2264 1 and X0/X1 \u2264 3 Pass\nWith subject generator interconnected the maximum modeled R0/X1 is 0.7782 PU and the maximum\nmodelled X0/X1 is 1.6018 PU.\nSCADA Required EMS Visibility for Monitoring & Control Fail\nGeneration Sources Requirements\nThe 4.20 MW subject generator triggers the requirement for SCADA reporting to the Utility.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s feasibility, determine its impact\nto the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and installation\nrequirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the Interconnection\nCustomer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This Coordinated Electric\nSystem Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the NYSSIR Section I.C Step 6; identifies the\nscope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection Customer\u2019s installation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the\nInterconnection Customer is:\nOption 1 Connect Prior to FY25 Workplan at 1,500kW: Under this option the Customer moves\nforward with interconnection downsizing their site to 1,500 kW for reasons outlined in the thermal\nsection of the study. Interconnection upgrades required amount to $1,525,402.\nOption 2 Connect Post FY25 Workplan at 3,500kW: Under this option the Customer postpones\ninterconnection until the completion of an existing project in the FY25 workplan that will split the\nElnora 56 feeder and create the new Elnora 55 feeder, which this interconnecting generator would\nbe connected to. Interconnection upgrades required amount to $758,169.\nThe interconnection was found to be feasible with modifications to the existing Company EPS\nand operating conditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit\nduring normal Utility operating conditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service,\nor if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in effect National Grid reserves the\nright to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection\nhas been studied. Any increase in system size and/or design change is subject to a new study\nand costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An increase in system size\nmay also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 4 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Elnora\nTransformer Name TB2\nTransformer Peak Load (kVA) 20,000\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (as applicable) (kW) 4,066\nDaytime Light Load (kW) 6,778\nGeneration: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 16,793; 10,849; 2,444\nContingency Condition Generation: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 16,462; 10,565; 2,397\nSupply Voltage (kV) 115\nTransformer Summer Normal Rating (kVA) 27,900\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation Yes\nTransmission GFOV Status Installed\nBus Tie No\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 3\nConnecting Feeder/Line 44256\nPeak Load on Feeder (kW) 7,516\nDaytime Light Load on Feeder (kW) 1,612\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 13.2\nLine Phasing at POI 3\u00d8\nCircuit Distance from POI to Substation 4.2 miles\nDistance to Nearest 3-phase (if applicable) N/A\nLine Regulation Yes\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI Effective\nOther Generation: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 15,500; 9,586; 2,414\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI\nInterconnection Customer POI Location P26 180 Blue Barns Rd\nI 3-phase (3LLL) 2,025 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1,378 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA Base) 1.3466 + j3.5809 pu\nZ0 (100 MVA Base) 2.9947 + j8.7127 pu\n1 The total value referenced here includes the subject generator, connected generation, and generation that is\nqueued ahead.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 5 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new primary service connection with Account No.\n67520-52007.\nThis location is presently served by National Grid, thereby only requiring a 3-phase extension to\nthe point of common coupling (PCC) from National Grid\u2019s radial 13.2 kV distribution feeder\n44256 from the Elnora substation.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\u2022 A PV system (DC) consisting of 7,228 Zinshine Solar ZXM7-SHLDD144-540M solar\npanels (540 W) for a total DC system size of 3,903 kW .\nDC\n\u2022 Fourteen (14) Solectria solar (XGI-1500-250) inverters (250 kW, 600 V ) for a total AC\nAC\nsystem size of 2, kW .\nAC\n\u2022 Two (1) 1,750 kVA, 13.2 kV / 600 V , wye-grounded primary / wye-grounded\nAC AC\nsecondary, step-up transformer with Z=5.75% and X/R=8.62.\n\u2022 One (1) primary connected 500 kVA zig-zag grounding transformer with Z=6% and\nX/R=4\n\u2022 Customer-owned riser pole (C5) with solid blade cutouts and lightning arrestors.\n\u2022 Customer-owned pole (C4) with Customer-owned primary meter and lightning arrestors.\n\u2022 Customer-owned pole (C3) with National Grid utility-owned primary meter and lightning\narrestors.\n\u2022 Customer-owned pole (C2) with Customer Recloser and lightning arrestors.\n\u2022 Customer-owned pole (C1) with gang operated, lockable, main generator disconnect\nswitch and lightning arrestors.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 6 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage <105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the maximum voltage as modeled on the feeder will\nbe within acceptable limits.\nVoltage Undervoltage >95% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator, the minimum voltage as modeled on the feeder will\nbe within acceptable limits.\nSubstation Regulation for <100% Minimum\nVoltage Pass\nReverse Power Load Criteria\nThe total generation on feeders 44256, 44257, and 44258 will be 16.793 MW. The total\nminimum load on these feeders is 6.778 MW. The generation to load ratio will be 248%, thereby\nrequiring a replacement of the substation LTC with a bi-directional, co-generation capable LTC\ncontroller, however, a prior connected DG triggered the need for protection mitigation methods\nand has since been installed; no further action is required.\nFeeder Regulation for <100% Minimum Load to\nVoltage Pass\nReverse Power Generation Ratio\nThe total generation downstream of voltage regulator on P64 will be 9.7 MW. The minimum\nload downstream of the voltage regulator is .34 MW. The regulator has bi-directional voltage\nregulation enabled; no further action is required.\n<3% Steady State from\nProposed Generation\non the Feeder\nVoltage Fluctuation Pass\n<5% Steady State from\nAggregate DER on the\nSubstation Bus\nThe greatest voltage fluctuation on the feeder occurs near P.71 Ashdown Rd. The resulting\nfluctuation at the feeder location is 1.5% due to the proposed generation and <1% on the\nsubstation bus due to the aggregate generation.\nVoltage Screen H Flicker <0.350 Emissions Limit Pass\nThe P for the location with the greatest voltage fluctuation is 0.1438 and the emissions limit is\nst\n0.35.\nEquipment\nThermal (Continuous Current) <100% Thermal Limits Fail\nRatings\nThe subject generator's full output current will be 153 Amps, the subject generator triggers two\noverloading concerns on the 44256 Feeder. For both thermal limitations described below there\nis approximately 680 Amps/phase of DER connected downstream of the thermally overloaded\nequipment.\nThe first thermal violation occurs on the overhead 336 AL 165 MIL covered tree wire starting at\nP53-1/2 Ballston Lake Rd and continuing East 0.71 miles to riser P66 Ballston Lake Rd.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 7 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nThe second thermal violation occurs on the underground 750 AL starting at riser P66 Ballston\nLake Rd and continuing 400\u2019 into the Elnora substation.\nOption 1 Downsize/Derate site to 1,500kW: Downsize/Derate subject generator to 1,500 kW\nupgrade the 0.71 miles of overloaded overhead to 477 AL 160 MIL covered tree wire, and\nreplace the 400\u2019 of underground cable and conduit with 1000MCM CU.\nOption 2 Postpone Interconnection and Interconnect at 3,500kW: Postpone interconnection\nuntil the completion of an existing project in the FY25 workplan that will split the Elnora 56\nfeeder and create the new Elnora 55 feeder, which this interconnecting generator would be\nconnected to. This alternative would result in no thermal related upgrades as the getaway for\nthe new feeder would be 1000 MCM CU and the overhead would be 477 AL.\nEquipment\nWithstand (Fault Current) <90% Withstand Limits Pass\nRatings\nThe additional fault current contribution from the generation does not contribute to\ninterrupting ratings in excess of existing EPS equipment.\nUnintentional Islanding\nProtection Unintentional Islanding Document & Company Fail\nGuidelines\nThe subject generator is a 3.5 MW PV generation system. The subject generation exceeds the\nCompany\u2019s criteria for islanding a distributed resource under light load conditions and will\nrequire a National Grid protection and control package.\nProtection Protective Device Coordination Company Guidelines Fail\nThere will be one Cooper Form 6 recloser R24039 between the subject generator\u2019s POI and the\nElnora substation. A previous DG in queue is required to replace this recloser with one capable\nof voltage sensing for reclose blocking. Should this previous DG withdraw, the subject generator\nshall be required to upgrade R24039 with voltage sensing for reclose blocking. The\nInterconnection Customer currently proposed overcurrent protection for this system is a\nCustomer-owned recloser with a SEL-651R controller, however, a complete set of settings was\nnot provided for review. The Interconnection Customer shall revise the site\u2019s overcurrent\nprotection settings to provide adequate coordination with the Company\u2019s upstream protective\ndevice listed below in accordance with IEEE 242 Table 15-3.\nRecloser R24039:\n- OC Phase Relay Settings: Kyle-163, PU=300A, Time Multiplier=1.0, Instantaneous: N/A\n- OC Ground Relay Settings: Kyle-163 Curve, PU=300A, Time Multiplier =1.0, Instantaneous: N/A\nIf the subject generator proceeds to construction, final settings will be determined and provided\nto the Customer as part of the Utility\u2019s review for adequate coordination. The 50, 51, 50N, and\n51N functions must be enabled as highlighted by ESB 756B to provide appropriate coordination\nwith the interconnected distribution system. Settings for these elements shall be submitted to\nt he Company for acceptance review.\nRated Capabilities\nProtection Fault Sensitivity Pass\nof EPS Equipment\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 8 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nFault studies show that contribution from the subject generator for faults on the feeder will not\nhave a significant increase in fault current seen by utility equipment. Aggregate source fault\ncontribution with the addition of the subject generator is within the rated capabilities of EPS\nequipment.\nProtection Ground Fault Detection Reduction of Reach >0% Fail\nThe Interconnection Customer has proposed two 1,750kVA grounded wye primary \u2013 grounded\nwye secondary interconnection transformer with an impedance of 5.75% and X/R ratio of 8.62\nand a 500 kVA primary grounding bank with a proposed impedance of 6.0% and X/R ratio of 4.0.\nTo be within Company guidelines, the grounding bank shall have a per phase impedance of 50.8\nOhms. With this grounding transformer in service, the Interconnection Customer will contribute\napproximately 88A of 3I0 current to remote bolted line to ground faults and 238A to faults at\nthe PCC.\nOvervoltage -\nProtection Company 3V0 Criteria Pass\nTransmission System Fault\nThe generation to load ratio on the serving distribution system has failed the Company\u2019s\nplanning threshold in which transmission ground fault overvoltage become an electrical hazard\ndue to the distribution source contribution. However, 3V0 protection has already been installed\nby a prior DG and the subject generator is still responsible to make their cost sharing\ncontribution in accordance with the NY SIR.\nOvervoltage -\nProtection <125% Voltage Rise Pass\nDistribution System Fault\nWith subject generator interconnected the modeled voltage rise on the unfaulted phases of the\nsystem is 123%.\nProtection Effective Grounding R0/X1<1; X0/X1<3 Pass\nWith subject generator interconnected the modeled R0/X1 is 0.90007 PU and the X0/X1 is\n2.48931 PU.\nRequired EMS Visibility for Monitoring & Control\nSCADA Pass\nGeneration Sources Requirements\nWith subject generator interconnected the modeled R0/X1 is 0.76364 PU and the X0/X1 is\n2.31159 PU.\nOther\nThe result of the study analyzed two (2) options.\nOption 1: Interconnection prior to the FY25 workplan on Elnora 44256, which results in the\nthermal overload of the 750AL getaway cable out of the substation as well as overloading 0.71\nmiles of 336 AL 165 MIL covered tree wire triggered by reverse power flow in excess of the\nequipment thermal limits.\nOption 2: Postpone interconnection until after FY25 workplan is completed and the new Elnora\n44255 is constructed, which results in no thermal upgrades triggered by the subject generator.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. # SP.NY - 479210\nInterconnect Review Page 9 of 12\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version \u2013 6.12.23\n6.0 MITIGATIONS FOR SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS FAILURES\nDetail below is intended to provide sufficient information and clarity to give the Interconnection\nCustomer an understanding to the relationship of costs and scope associated with the DER\ninterconnection and the system modifications due to the DER impact.

The resulting fluctuation at the\nfeeder location is 1.5% due to the proposed generation.\nVoltage Flicker Screen H Flicker Pass\nThe Pst for the location with the greatest voltage fluctuation is 0.079 and the emissions limit is 0.35.\nEquipment Thermal (continuous current) < 100% thermal limits Pass\nRatings\nThe subject generator's full output current is 87.5A. The total full output current of all DER\ndownstream of the overhead conductor at P9 Route 345 is 91A. The overhead conductor thermal\ncapabilities are 230A. The following system upgrades are required:\nEquipment Withstand (fault current) <90% withstand limits Pass\nRatings\nThe additional fault current contribution from the generation does not contribute to interrupting\nratings in excess of existing EPS equipment.\nProtection Unintentional Islanding Unintentional Islanding Document & Fail\nCompany Guidelines\nThe subject generator is a 2.0 MVA PV generation system.\nThe proposed generation system exceeds the Company\u2019s criteria for islanding a distributed resource,\ntherefore unintentional islanding is a concern. Therefore, the following system upgrades are required:\nNational Grid Protection and Control package (e.g. the PCC Recloser)\nProtection Protective device coordination Company Guidelines Fail\nDoc. # 363692\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 7 of 10\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 1/7/2022\nThe DG Interconnection Customer has proposed a utility-grade recloser for use as primary service\nprotection. This protective device is shown in the proper location on the submitted line diagrams.\nPreliminary overcurrent settings were not provided in the initial submittals. Both ground and phase\ninstantaneous and time curve overcurrent settings will need to be provided in this recloser, as well\nas ESB-756B Power Quality functions (27,59,81).\nThe DG Interconnection Customer will need ensure that this recloser will coordinate, with 0.25 second\nmargin, to the following device characteristics:\n50/51 = P/U \u2013 400 A, Curve \u2013 U2, Time Dial/Multiplier = 1\n50/51N = P/U \u2013 300 A, Curve \u2013 U2, Time Dial/Multiplier = 1\nIf the customer chooses to use a fuse instead, then the customer shall submit formal fuse\nspecifications for review and approval by National Grid to ensure proper coordination, correct\nfunction types, etc. if the project moves forward. These files will be required in their native format\n(SEL AcSELerator, Cooper Proview, etc.) when submitted.\nProtection Fault Sensitivity Rated capabilities of EPS Fail\nequipment\nOf the currently active protectives devices (line reclosers, Station breaker relays) on this portion of\nthe system, Brady Feeder 58 Overcurrent Relays and existing line fusing were impacted negatively by\nthe addition of this Interconnection. Therefore, the following system upgrades are required:\nRemove Existing P14 40k Fuse\nNew Line Recloser Installation (6IVS Recloser w/ SEL-651R and Deadline Sensing) at P14\nNew settings will be issued for these reclosers prior to installation.\nProtection Ground Fault Detection Reduction of Reach Fail\nThe DG Interconnection Customer has proposed one (1) 2,000 kVA Yg/\u2206 transformer with a 6.2 \u03a9\nneutral grounding reactor (NGR). This impedance is too small.\nA revised unit was used in this analysis and it satisfies the requirements for effective grounding and\nprovides current limiting in order to satisfactorily comply with National Grid standards.\nWith these NGRs in service, the DG Interconnection Customer will contribute approximately 118 A of\n3I0 current to remote bolted line to ground faults and 239 A to faults at the PCC.\nProtection Overvoltage - Transmission System Company 3V0 criteria Fail\nFault\nThe interconnection of distributed generation facilities to National Grid distribution substations can\nresult in conditions whereby line-to-ground faults on the transmission system could go undetected. This\nscenario was analyzed for the proposed interconnection to determine if the addition of the subject\ngenerator meets the Company\u2019s criteria for requiring transmission system line-to-ground fault\nprotection.\nThe existing station protection schemes were reviewed, and analysis performed, and it has been\ndetermined that the addition of this DG Interconnection triggers the requirement for transmission\nsystem ground fault protection. Therefore, the following system upgrades are required:\nDoc. # 363692\nCoordinated Electric System\nInterconnect Review Page 8 of 10\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013 1/7/2022\nAn 3V protection scheme is required to mitigate the transmission system line-to-ground fault\n0\ncondition.\nProtection Overvoltage - Distribution System < 125 % voltage rise Pass\nFault\nWith subject generator interconnected the maximum modeled voltage rise on the unfaulted phases\nof the system is 122.8%.\nProtection Effective Grounding R0/X1 \u2264 1 and X0/X1 \u2264 3 Pass\nWith subject generator interconnected the maximum modeled R0/X1 is 0.8190 PU and the maximum\nmodelled X0/X1 is 2.2418 PU.\nSCADA Required EMS Visibility for Monitoring & Control Fail\nGeneration Sources Requirements\nThe 2.0 MVA subject generator triggers the requirement for SCADA reporting to the Utility. This\nrequirement is covered by the following:\nNational Grid Protection and Control package (e.g. the PCC Recloser)\nOther Interconnection Fail\nThe Proposed POI is located 2200ft from a 13.2kV 3-phase line. The following upgrade is required:\nConvert a 4.8kV single phase to 13.2kV three phase.\n6.0 MITIGATIONS FOR SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS FAILURES\nDetail below is intended to provide sufficient information and clarity to give the Interconnection\nCustomer an understanding to the relationship of costs and scope associated with the DER\ninterconnection and the system modifications due to the DER impact.

The intent of this report is to assess this project\u2019s feasibility, determine\nits impact to the existing electric power system (EPS), determine interconnection scope and\ninstallation requirements, and determine costs associated with interconnecting the\nInterconnection Customer\u2019s generation to the Company\u2019s Electric Power System (EPS). This\nCoordinated Electric System Impact Review (CESIR) study; according to the NYSSIR Section I.C\nStep 6; identifies the scope, schedule, and costs specific to this Interconnection Customer\u2019s\ninstallation requirements.\n2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe total estimated planning grade cost of the work associated with the interconnection of the\nInterconnection Customer is $285,406.\nThe interconnection was found to NOT be feasible at the proposed size. The site must be\ndownsized to 300 kW along with modifications to the existing Company EPS and operating\nconditions, which are described in detail in the body of this Study. The point of common coupling\n(PCC) will be discussed during the initial construction field visit. The Customer is responsible for\nextending their facilities to meet the company at the PCC. The Company is currently proposing a\ntap off the existing 13.2 kV feeder and placement of a pole with a Company owned recloser. If\nthe Company needs to provide a line extension, additional costs will be incurred by the Customer.\nThe ability to generate is contingent on this facility being served by the interconnecting circuit\nduring normal Utility operating conditions. Therefore, if the interconnecting circuit is out of service,\nor if abnormal Utility operating conditions of the area EPS are in effect National Grid reserves the\nright to disengage the facility.\nNo future increase in generation output beyond that which specified herein for this interconnection\nhas been studied. Any increase in system size and/or design change is subject to a new study\nand costs associated shall be borne by the Interconnection Customer. An increase in system size\nmay also forfeit the Interconnection Customer\u2019s existing queue position.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. #506455\nInterconnect Review Page 4 of 12\nNational Grid\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013\n12/22/2023\n3.0 COMPANY EPS PARAMETERS\nSubstation Sandy Creek\nTransformer Name TB2\nTransformer Peak Load (kW) 6,100\nContingency Condition Load, N-1 Criteria (kW) (as applicable) N/A\nDaytime Light Load (kW) 601\nGeneration: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead (kW) 7,817, 6,317, 0\nContingency Condition Generation: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead\nN/A\n(kW)\nSupply Voltage (kV) 34.5\nTransformer Maximum Nameplate Rating (kVA) 6,600\nDistribution Bus Voltage Regulation yes\nTransmission GFOV Status installed\nBus Tie N/A\nNumber of Feeders Served from this Bus 2\nConnecting Feeder/Line 6651\nPeak Load on feeder (kW) 3,081\nDaytime Light Load on Feeder (kW) 329\nFeeder Primary Voltage at POI (kV) 13.2\nLine Phasing at POI 3\nCircuit Distance from POI to Substation 0.89 miles\nDistance to nearest 3-phase, (if applicable) n/a\nLine Regulation N\nLine/Source Grounding Configuration at POI effective\nGeneration: Total1, Connected, Queued Ahead(kW) 5,594, 4,094, 0\nSystem Fault Characteristics without Interconnection Customer DG at POI\nInterconnection Customer POI Location Pole 17, Ellisburg St\nI 3-phase (3LLL) 1,180 Amps\nI Line to Ground (3I0) 1,273 Amps\nZ1 (100 MVA base) 0.9086 + j 4.2545 PU\nZ0 (100 MVA base) 0.4782 + j 2.5759 PU\n1 The total value referenced here includes the subject generator, connected generation and\ngeneration that is queued ahead.\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. #506455\nInterconnect Review Page 5 of 12\nNational Grid\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013\n12/22/2023\n4.0 INTERCONNECTION CUSTOMER SITE\nThe Interconnection Customer is proposing a new solar photovoltaic primary service connection\nwith Account No. 25456-06015.\nThis location is presently served via the Company\u2019s 13.2kV radial distribution feeder 6651 from\nSandy Creek Substation.\nThe proposed generating system consists of:\n\uf0b7 3-phase PV inverts with a generation total of 1,500kW.\n\uf0b7 One (1) 3,425VA wye-ground/delta step up transformer.\n\uf0b7 One (1) Primary neutral grounding reactor.\n\uf0b7 Gang operated disconnect switch\n\uf0b7 Pole mounted Customer recloser\n\uf0b7 Primary Utility Meter\n\uf0b7 Gang operated disconnect switch\nCoordinated Electric System Doc. #506455\nInterconnect Review Page 6 of 12\nNational Grid\nDistributed Energy Resources - NYSSIR Version 1.0 \u2013\n12/22/2023\n5.0 SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS\nCategory Criteria Limit Result\nVoltage Overvoltage < 105% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator the maximum voltage as modeled on the Feeder is 103.8% of\nnominal.\nVoltage Undervoltage > 95% (ANSI C84.1) Pass\nWith the addition of the subject generator the minimum voltage as modeled on the line does not violate\nthe limit.\nVoltage Substation Regulation for Reverse minimum load criteria Fail\nPower\nThe total generation on Feeders 6651 and 6652 is 7.82 MW.
